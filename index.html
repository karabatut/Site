                    <h6>CEO and Lead Game Developer</h6>
                    <p>
                      Worked on 2 Mobile and 1 PC games as Lead Game Developer to a 4 people crew.

                    <h6>Chroma Defense</h6>
                    <p>
                      A test-bed to gauge our abilities and how the game market performs. It's a simple game where the player
                      had to rotate a color shield to intercept incoming stuff by matching their colors. Aside from normal 
                      development, worked on integrating Unity Ads and In-App Purchases.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Ur Legacy</h6>
                    <p>
                      This game was based on the 4000 year old board game "Royal Game of Ur". We put in some cosmetics and sumerian characters to the game,
                      and made it multiplayer. Didn't put ads though because I HATE ADS. We worked really hard to create a well made, well polished game, and I think
                      we got there.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Hissar</h6>
                    <p>
                      This is our current project. In this title we wanted to shift away from the mobile space to the PC market. There is less money to be made 
                      in the PC market but we found it to be more flexible in almost every aspect. This game is a combination of deck building and tower defense genres.
                      It is still in development but almost all of the basic functionality is present at the moment.

                      Since these tests were so low level tests, they were done using code. All of the tests were written in C++. 
                      Responsibilities included writing and running the tests, performing Software Coverage Analysis tests, reporting findings and performing FQTs. 
                      The tested drivers had to be certified as Level-A, so the tests were run according to the DO-178B guidelines.</p>
